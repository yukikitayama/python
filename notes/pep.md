## Docstring

`__doc__` attribute, any string literals after the definition of a function/module/class/method

`help(object)`

Module docstring should list classes, exceptions, and functions with one-line summary of each.

Function docstring should summarize its behaviour, and document arguments, returned value, side effects, exceptions, and
restrictions when it's called.

Class docstring should summarize the behavior and purpose, not provide detailed listing of methods and attributes.
